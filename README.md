  ## Description

  This file uses the command line to acquire user input and then populate an HTML file based on this. It is an exercise in Object Oriented Programming as the main functionaility is derived from classes. Additionally it uses the Jest test suite to run some basic unit tests, as an introduction to test driven design.

  ## Installation

  Once the file has been cloned to your preferred file location, you will need to open it in your IDE and open the terminal. Once there you will need to run the command `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies. This should include inquirer.

  Open the command line and run the command `node index.js`. You will then be prompted with a series of questions to provide the necessary data to populate our HTML file. The manager is the only necessary field, then any number of interns/engineers can be added. Once done you can end the process by choosing n in the add another employee question. This will cause the index.html file to be created. IMPORTANT! The link to the css in the HTML file will need to be updated if this file is moved anywhere else.
